## Reindeer Config
##
## This file sets all of Reindeer's basic configuration. This file also marks
## the top of the reindeer-managed directory, as all other paths are relative to
## this one (both paths mentioned in this file, and implicit).
##
## Reindeer is under active development, and the layout and options in this file
## may change.

# Parse Rust code to work out the precise set of source files for each crate.
# This uses `srcfiles` which only works on Rust 2018 and without some macro
# constructions. It works in almost all cases, but you may need to have a
# fixups.toml adding extra srcs if it fails.
precise_srcs = true

# Possible patterns for license files - lots of packages have them without
# registering them in the Cargo metadata, or have more than the single file it
# allows. Just look in the top-level dir for now.
license_patterns = ["LICENSE*", "COPYING*", "UNLICENSE*"]

# If a fixups.toml file is needed (eg, the package has a build.rs), then
# generate a template fixups.toml to be edited.
fixup_templates = true

# Include an explicit public top-level target which depends on all other library
# targets, so that you can to a test/check build.
include_top_level = true

# Configuration for vendoring
#
# You can instead set `vendor = false` to make Reindeer-generated targets not
# build from the vendored sources, but instead download sources from crates.io
# at build time.

# Exclude files listed in the .gitignore in this directory

# Additional globs to ignore (prefer .gitignore for consistentcy with source
# control)

# Platforms we want to support.
#
# A Reindeer platform is a collection of predicates, which are closely related
# to rustc/cargo's notion of a platform. If a conditional dependency matches
# against a platform's predicates, then it is included in the platform-specific
# dependencies in the rule.
#
# These same platforms and predicates are used in fixups.toml files, for
# platform-specific fixups (such as additional dependencies, extra sources,
# options, etc).
#
# Listed properties are a set of values, any of which can match a predicate.
# These match specific configurations of rustc, as shown with `rustc --target
# <TARGET> --print cfg`. Unlisted properties are "don't care" or "match
# anything"
#
# The platform key sets the name of the platform in `platform_deps` /
# `named_platform_deps`. If it is "DEFAULT" then the platform's dependencies are
# put into the normal `deps` / `named_deps`.
#
# CRUCIALLY, every [platform.xxx] key must match one in prelude/rust/cargo_package.bzl.
# If you wish to add new platforms, you will have to copy/paste the big
# DEFAULT_PLATFORM_TEMPLATES in that file and create your own wrappers (like cargo.rust_library)
# that call `apply_platform_attrs`.
