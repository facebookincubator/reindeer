# Reindeer Care and Feeding

(In progress)

## Introduction

One of Rustâ€™s strengths is its ecosystem of third-party crates. This ecosystem
is built around Cargo and crates.io. But what if you don't want to use Cargo?
What if you want to use a buildsystem like [Buck](https://buck.build)[^1]?

[^1]:
    Or potentially [Bazel](https://bazel.build), but nobody has tried that yet.

Reindeer is a tool intended to bridge that gap - it allows you to import Cargo
packages from crates.io, github, or whereever else they are stored, vendors them
and automatically generates Buck build rules so they can be built from source as
part of your normal build process.

This assumes your environment is:

1. A monorepo-like, in which all your sources are stored together and updated
   synchronously, and
2. You have a unified dependency graph in which all builds are managed by Buck.
   This means you use Buck for both your home-grown code as well as third-party
   code.

(Neither of these are absolutely mandatory; they're just the environment the
tool was developed in. Your experience may vary depending on how close your
environment matches this.)

## An Example

See the [first example directory](../examples/01-intro/) as a starting point. 
This has:

- Your first-party code in "project" (though of course it can be anywhere and
  everywhere), and
- A [third-party](../examples/01-intro/third-party) directory which is managed 
  by Reindeer
- A [`setup.sh`](../examples/01-intro/setup.sh) script to get you bootstrapped

Running `setup.sh` will build Reindeer (using Cargo) and then use it to vendor
the small number of third-party dependencies defined in
[`third-party/Cargo.toml`](../examples/01-intro/third-party/Cargo.toml) and 
generate build rules
for them in `third-party/BUCK`.

I recommend using this as a starting template for your own project, at least
until you're familiar enough with how everything works to do it yourself.

(There's quite a lot else in there, but we'll get to that.)

## Basic Workflow

You're working away on your code, and you suddenly need to use something from
crates.io. What do you do?

1. Add the specification to `[dependencies]` in `third-party/Cargo.toml`, as you
   would if this were a Cargo project. You can use all the usual options, from a
   simple `foo = "1.2"` to adding features, defining a local name, and so on.
2. Run `reindeer --third-party-dir third-party vendor`. This will resolve the
   new dependencies (creating or updating `Cargo.lock`), vendor all the new code
   in the `third-party/vendor` directory (also deleting unused code)
3. Run `reindeer --third-party-dir third-party buckify`. This will analyze the
   Cargo dependencies and (re)generate the BUCK file accordingly. If this
   succeeds silently then there's a good chance that nothing more is needed.
4. Do a test build with `buck build //third-party:new-package#check` to make
   sure it is basically buildable.

Points to note:

- If any of the packages you're importing (either the ones you're explicitly
  importing or their dependencies) has a `build.rs` build script, you'll need a
  `fixups.toml` file for that package to tell Reindeer how to handle it. See
  [fixups](#Fixups) for details.
- The `vendor` directory is completely under Reindeer's control, and can be
  deleted and regenerated at any time. Do not make any manual local changes in
  there. See [below](#Local-Patches) for details on how to maintain local
  changes.
- Likewise `BUCK` is always completely regenerated by `reindeer buckify`. The
  generated rules can be customized in the
  [reindeer configuration](#Configuring-Reindeer) or in the
  [rule macros](#Buck-Macros).

## Vendoring and Managing Versions

Reindeer maintains a directory of all third-party sources used during a build.
The expectation is that they are committed along with your own code so that they
are all updated in lockstep. It also means the build process needs no network
IO.

### Multiple versions of one package

This model of managing third-party code pushes heavily on the idea that there's
only one version of any given package in use. If you're doing an update and it
introduces some minor changes, I'd suggest updating the callsites to the new API
rather than introducing a new version.

Sometimes, however, it's impractical to update everything. When there's a large
API change - or even a whole ecosystem change - then its not practical to
migrate everything at once. In this case you can introduce a second (or more)
version.

For example:

```
[dependencies]
tokio_old = { package = "tokio", version = "0.1" }
tokio = "0.2"
```

Note that even if you don't do this, you could have multiple versions of each
package vendored and part of you build dependency graph - when resolving
versions, Cargo will pull in as many versions as it needs to satisfy everyone's
dependencies. They will almost always happily co-exist.

### Specifying features

You can specify features in the normal way:

```
specialpackage = { version = "10.2", features = ["magic] }
```

### Importing from Git

You are not limited to just crates from crates.io - you can also use packages
which have not yet been published using `git` references.

Note that if you're switching a dependency between fetched from crates.io and
git, you'll need to manually delete the vendored code to avoid a bug in
[cargo vendor](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/issues/8181). You can be
indiscriminate about this, up to removing the entire content of the `vendor/`
dir.

### Dealing with merge conflicts

If two people are updating the third-party repo at once, there's the possibility
of collisions. The most likely place to get a collision is in `Cargo.toml` (if
the entries are near each other) and `Cargo.lock` (similarly). These can be
resolved in the normal way, but its worth re-running a vendor operation after
updating Cargo.lock to make sure the results are consistent.

Alternatively you can simply delete `Cargo.lock`, but that will cause everything
to be re-resolved (see [bulk updates](#bulk-updates)).

## Buckifying

In the best - and most common - case, generating Buck build rules is completely
automated. If the crate has no build script (and is therefore pure Rust), then
the chances are high that the generated rules will Just Work.

Even if they don't, most cases can be solved with a one or two line annotation.

## Fixups

Fixups are annotations to help Reindeer generate correct build rules for the
Cargo packages. They're generally only needed when the Cargo build does
something that's not precisely described by the Cargo metadata, such as the
arbitrary actions of build scripts.

Fixups are defined in `fixups/<package name>/fixups.toml`. The package name is
the base name, not including any version information. The fixups directory also
contains other files as needed.

### Extra sources

By default Reindeer will simply add all `*.rs` files as the `srcs` for the rule.
If you're using the `precise_srcs` option then it will attempt to identify all
the sources by actually parsing the code. Both of these can fail from time to
time - such as by `include!()` of unexpected files, or when files or modules are
introduced by macros.

These extra sources can be added with

```
extra_srcs = [ ... ]
```

in `fixups.toml`, where the extra sources are specified as one or more globs.

### Environment variables

Some packages use version and other information from Cargo via a set of
environment variables. If a build fails with a message about `CARGO_<something>`
not being defined, then you can add `cargo_env = true` to `fixups.toml`.

Sometimes they need an arbitrary environment variable to be defined. You can
specify this with

```
env = { "FOO" = "Value of FOO" }
```
