# Reindeer - Building Cargo Packages with Buck [![Build Status](https://github.com/facebookincubator/reindeer/actions/workflows/build-and-test.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/facebookincubator/reindeer/actions)

Jeremy Fitzhardinge <jsgf@fb.com>

This is a set of tools for importing Rust crates from crates.io, git repos, etc
and generating Buck build rules for them. Currently it primarily solves the
problem of managing third-party dependencies in a monorepo built with
[Buck](https://buck.build/), but my hope is that it can be extended to support
[Bazel](https://bazel.build/) and other similar build systems.

## Installation and Building

Reindeer builds with Cargo in the normal way. It has no unusual build-time
dependencies. Therefore, you can use Cargo to not only build Reindeer, but to
install it as well.

```shell
cargo install --locked --git https://github.com/facebookincubator/reindeer reindeer
```

### Nix

If you are using [Nix](https://nixos.org/), you can install Reindeer from
[nixpkgs](https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs) via the `reindeer` package. This
package is unofficial and community-maintained.

## Getting started
